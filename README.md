Vehicle Detection and Classification in Aerial Imagery
The aim of this project is to develop an efficient and robust system for detecting and classifying vehicles from aerial platforms (e.g., drones, satellites). It addresses challenges like small object size, cluttered backgrounds, and varying lighting conditions.

âœ… Key Features:
Radiometric Calibration & Preprocessing for enhancing aerial image quality

Conditional Random Field (CRF) for precise vehicle-background segmentation

YOLOv8 for real-time and high-accuracy vehicle detection

Feature Extraction using MSER, BRIEF, and Affine-SIFT

Feature Optimization using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

Classification using Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN)

Evaluation on multiple datasets including AU-AIR, UAVDT, and Roundabout Imagery
